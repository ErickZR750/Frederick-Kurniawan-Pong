Assignment is over. Once again I failed to become a Programmer.

<h1>AGC Batch #5 in 2D Programming</h1>
This is an assignment in my AGC's session from November 20th to December 20th, 2023. Currently tasked to recreate a video game called "Pong."
<br>
List of bugs or problem that may need to ask for help or fix it myself:
<ul>
  <li><strike>Ball refuses to "ricochet" even hitting the ball with moving paddle and Bounce with Friction function is already set. Current workaround is by setting the starting ball speed slanted (x = 6, y = 2)</strike></li>
  <li><strike>Power-up effects are activated endlessly instead of dissipates after a certain amount of time. Even worse, you can stack it up. This somehow did not cover in this week's assignment.</strike></li>
  <li>Coroutine conflict preventing to dissipate power ups over time.</li>
  <li>Extra Long paddle power up failed to work. Delisted from Manager.</li>
  <li>Fast paddles couldn't bother putting it in since I still don't know how to deal with Coroutine.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Might as well make a changelog here to make this Readme more entertaining:
<h3>Failed Prototype v0.0.0.0.4</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Added Back to Main Menu buttons.</li>
  <li>Author button is now somewhat Credits.</li>
</ol>
Yes I still have to Commit that failed build somehow because of the deadline assignment. Ready or not.
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.3</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Added (seemingly broken as it sounds) power-up system.</li>
  <li>Ball finally ricochets when hitting with moving paddle.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.2 Revision 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Both paddles body type is Dynamic instead of Kinematic to prevent going through walls.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Added Main Menu</li>
  <li>Added Scoring System</li>
  <li>Ball returns to arena after goal</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Base gameplay only. Doesn't even count as a game yet.</li>
</ol>
