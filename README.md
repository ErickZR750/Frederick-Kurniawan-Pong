<h1>AGC Batch #5 in 2D Programming</h1>
This is an assignment in my AGC's session from November 20th to December 20th, 2023. Currently tasked to recreate a video game called "Pong."
<br>
List of bugs or problem that may need to ask for help or fix it myself:
<ul>
  <li>Ball refuses to "ricochet" even hitting the ball with moving paddle and Bounce with Friction function is already set. Current workaround is by setting the starting ball speed slanted (x = 2, y = 0)</li>
</ul>
<br>
I'll also make a changelong here to make this Readme more entertaining:
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.2 Revision 1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Both paddles body type is Dynamic instead of Kinematic to prevent going through walls.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.2</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Added Main Menu</li>
  <li>Added Scoring System</li>
  <li>Ball returns to arena after goal</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v0.0.0.0.1</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Base gameplay only. Doesn't even count as a game yet.</li>
</ol>
