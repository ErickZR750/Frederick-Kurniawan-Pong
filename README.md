<h1>AGC Batch #5 in 2D Programming</h1>
This is an assignment in my AGC's session in November 20th to December 20th, 2023. Currently tasked to create a video game called "Pong.

I should list here that may need to be ask to anyone or fix it myself:
<ul>
  <li>Bad physics: Ball refuses to "ricochet" even hitting the ball with moving paddle and even the friction is already set.</li>
</ul>

Should've stick to Web Engineering...
