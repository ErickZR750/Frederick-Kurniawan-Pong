<h1>AGC Batch #5 in 2D Programming</h1>
This is an assignment in my AGC's session from November 20th to December 20th, 2023. Currently tasked to create a video game called "Pong."
<br>
List of bugs that may need to ask help or fix it myself:
<ul>
  <li>Bad physics: Ball refuses to "ricochet" even hitting the ball with moving paddle and even the friction is already set. Current workaround is by setting the starting position X to 2 to give "ricochet" feeling.</li>
</ul>
<br>
After Week 2 assignment is completed, it might be nice to put some Changelog here to give me bad memories:
<h3>Prototype v 0.0.0.0.2 (Codename: Week 2 Assignment)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Added Main Menu</li>
  <li>Added Scoring System (Default maximum score is 5)</li>
  <li>Ball returns to arena after goal</li>
</ol>
<h3>Prototype v 0.0.0.0.1 (Codename: Week 1 Assignment)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Base gameplay only</li>
</ol>
